# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to clean, manipulate, and present data in such a way so as to provide insight into efficacy of schools by size, budget per student, and type of school. Likewise I gathered pertinent data providing a view of average test scores in reading and math. Upon learning about possible academic dishonesty among the 9th grade class at Thomas High School we also set their test values to null and reran our analysis.

## Results

* The district summary was only marginally effected by omitting the 9th Grade test scores at Thomas High School.

* The school summary was not affected at all for all schools execpt for Thomas High School. 

* Thomas High School had one of the highest passing math and reading percentages out of all the schools, but once the ninth graders scores are taken out, they drop to one of the lowest. 

### Closer Analysis of Changes
* Math and reading scores at Thomas High School are now Nan since we took them out as opposed to an acutal value in the table.

* The percentage passing for reading and math as well as the overall percentage decline for school with $630-$644 allocated to each student by approximately 6% after we change the data to exclude the 9th graders at Thomas High School.

* The percentages for passing math and reading as well as the overall percentage declined for medium sized schools by approximately 6 percentage points.

* The percentages for passing math and reading as well as the overall percentage declined for Charter schools by approximately 4 percentage points.

## Summary

The major changes we can see that was caused by the data is how it has caused the performance of certain demographics of schools to look poorer, or rather, how their academic dishonesty made them look better. These demographics include charter schools, schools allocating $630-$644 per student, medium sized schools, and lastly Thomas High School itself, of course.
